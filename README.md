## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Venkatesh P, a **Data Scientist** in the making with a strong grasp of statistics, machine learning, and real-world data applications. Currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications** at the **University of Madras**, I thrive at the intersection of **healthcare, AI, and product thinking**.

From building predictive models and interactive dashboards to architecting full-stack ML apps, I enjoy making data work *for* people.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🌐 [Well-AI: Personalized Health Recommender App](https://github.com/venkatesh-hyper/Well-AI)
Well-AI is a comprehensive, **AI-powered** web application designed to provide **personalized health predictions** and wellness recommendations. Leveraging machine learning models and scalable web technologies, the app enables users to self-assess depression, predict diseases based on symptoms, and receive actionable lifestyle suggestions — all in a secure, user-friendly environment.

### 🧬 [Genetic Variation Analysis – Multiple Sclerosis (RUSA PROJECT) ](https://github.com/venkatesh-hyper/multiple-sclerosis)
Built a **real-time interactive dashboard** to assess MS risk using SNP data—blending bioinformatics with predictive analytics.

### 🧠 [Brain Tumor Classification](https://github.com/venkatesh-hyper/Brain-Tumour-classification)
Achieved **95% accuracy** in classifying brain tumor MRI images using an **ensemble model** combining SVM, RF, XGBoost, CNN, and transfer learning.

### 📝 [Text Generation with LSTM](https://github.com/venkatesh-hyper/textgen_LSTM)
Built an LSTM-based NLP model that generates **coherent and context-aware sequences**, demonstrating strong temporal understanding in language.

### 🏥 [DEPRESSION Prediction (mental_analysis)](https://depressanalysis.streamlit.app/)
This project is a Depression Prediction App built using Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and a pre-trained machine learning model. The app allows users to predict the likelihood of depression based on various input parameters, such as gender, age, sleep duration, family history, and mental health history. The prediction is powered by an ensemble machine learning model trained on a dataset of mental health indicators.

## A full-stack health recommendation web app that:

- Runs an **end-to-end ML pipeline** (data collection, preprocessing, model serving)
- Computes **real-time recommendations** using user inputs and stored historical data
- Hosts a **clean, modular dashboard** for mental health, general wellness, and symptom-based analysis
- Visualizes health trends using **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, and **interactive charts**
- Uses **React.js** for frontend and **FastAPI** for backend
